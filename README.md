# Chrome Extension (MV3) for Zap

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠️ When running the extension against a [notary server](https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsn/tree/dev/notary-server), please ensure that the server's version is the same as the version of this extension

## Content

Zap is a extension that currently uses TLSN ([see documentation](https://docs.tlsnotary.org/) to attest web2 data. TLS requests from Prover to Server can be witnessed by the Notary, and then can be transformed in signed proofs, which can be sent to webpages and used as attestations.

Zap has two types of proofs and exploration market to use them:
- **Dynamic proofs**: Generated by the SidePanel, these can be called by API from other webpages and attest specific data (like a google account ownership or a revolut transaction data)
- **Static proofs**: Auto generated by the Popup extension, these can be created by manual option in the extension and stored to use then, earning Zap points (like social account ownership)
- **Exploration market**: Solutions provided by Zap team which request data proofs generated by our extension.

## Flow Chart

### MPC:

![MPC Flowchart](https://github.com/0xZap/Zap-Data-Wallet/blob/main/Flowchart_DataWalletMPC.png)

### TLS Proxy:

_need to finish_

## Installing and Running using MPC

There are 3 code components:

- **Local Extension:** Responsible for the client
- **Local Notary Server:** Responsible for the local notarization with less latency
- **Local Websocket:** Responsible for the proxy between server and client

### Extension Procedures:

1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is >= **18**.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start`, it will generate a `build` folder.
5. Load your extension on Chrome following:
   1. Access `chrome://extensions/`
   2. Check `Developer mode`
   3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   4. Select the `build` folder.
6. Now use Zap.

### Local Notary Procedures:

1. Fork this repository: [Notary Server](https://github.com/tlsnotary/tlsn)
2. Run `git checkout v0.1.0-alpha.5` to adjust the server version (⚠️ Important!!)
3. Disable tls in the `config/config.yaml` file (write `false` instead `true` - line 18)
4. Run `cargo run --release` in the root folder
5. See the logs.

### Local Websocket Procedures:

1. Fork this repository: [Local Proxy](https://github.com/novnc/websockify)
2. Run `./docker/build.sh` to build image using Docker
3. Choose a host to perform a proxy:
   1. Example: Notarize `api.x.com`
   2. Certify if the host is present on the whitelist domains of TLSN
   3. Run `docker run -it --rm -p 55688:80 novnc/websockify 80 api.x.com:443`
5. Use it

## Installing and Running using TLS Proxy

There are 2 code components:

- **Local Extension:** Responsible for the client
- **Local Zap Websocket:** Responsible for handling the request with the server

### Extension Procedures:

1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is >= **18**.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm start`, it will generate a `build` folder.
5. Load your extension on Chrome following:
   1. Access `chrome://extensions/`
   2. Check `Developer mode`
   3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   4. Select the `build` folder.
6. Now use Zap.

### Websocket Procedures:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠️ Current version is not safe for private data

1. Fork or clone this repository: [Local Websocket](https://github.com/0xZap/Zap-Proxy)
2. Go in the javascript implementation in `./js/proxy`.
3. Run `node proxy.js`.
5. Now use Zap.

PS.: Current implementation is not using ZK and it's not secure

## Packing

After the development, run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. 

Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.
